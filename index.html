        <p class="text">Conway's Game of Life is one of the earliest cellular-automata simulations.
          The mathematician John Horton Conway devised it in 1970. In the early days, games like this
          would have had to be played on graph paper. Computers made it possible to explore the
          strange new worlds created by squares winking on and off.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          From a set of simple rules, a fascinating show of complex, almost lifelike patterns blooms
          in front of a viewer's eyes. You don't exactly play this game; rather, the game comes in
          applying rules that decide whether a square is dark ("alive") or blank ("dead") in the next
          round. There are only four rules.

          From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a>:
          <ul class="textList">
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text">This version of Conway's Game of Life lets you adjust the percentage of
          living cells at the beginning of the game; any value not between 0 and 100 will default
          to 50%. The highest and lowest percentages lead to
          stable board states very quickly; those somewhere in the middle can have very long
          lives. If the number of living cells hasn't changed in two generations, this game
          pauses. If you want, you can start the game back up and see if it springs back into
          continuing activity. Sometimes the number will change, but the board will have
          fallen into a stable, "oscillating" state of repeating patterns.
