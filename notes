things to do:

make it look good
don't let start button start if it's clear
--reset button should reset but not start
--clear button should stop interval as well
--

done:
make step, stop and start buttons work -- done
display number/percentage of living cells
--game now stops when board has been static for more than two rounds


ideas for things to add:

maybe turn board into an object which has properties for clear/not clear, moving/not moving,
  number of living cells...?
have color ramp slowly change every 100 generations?
let user vary the speed?
let user click tiles themselves to start?
let user add some common shapes
--or pick some of the good starting configurations
--let user vary percentage of living squares at beginning (for random option)
investigate redrawing algorithms
--let user pick different redrawing algorithm, and set speed to show differences
explanatory text -- maybe that pops up on hovering over certain tools?
--possible to make a border of all 0's, if wrap is not desired

things learned:

can't have it stop if number of living is equal for only one generation
--get value with   let input = document.getElementById("percentageInput").value,
  rather than .innerHTML
